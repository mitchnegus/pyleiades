## Energy data Visualization Routine

###### A tool for creating visuals from historical energy data (e.g. the EIA monthly energy review).
 
This tool is designed to provide insightful and aesthetic visualizations of the Energy Information Administration (EIA) energy consumption dataset. The dataset contains information about the sources of energy Americans have relied on for (electrical?) power since the middle of the 20$^{\text{th}}$ century. The dataset begins in 1949 with annual energy consumption values, and extends up until February 2017 where more recent energy consumption quantities are recorded monthly.

The basic energy sources are reported in the following groups:  

###### Fossil Fuels
* Coal
* Natural Gas
* Petroleum

###### Renewables
* Wind
* Solar
* Hydroelectric
* Geothermal
* Biomass

###### Nuclear
* Fission

All consumption values are reported in units of quadrillion btus. ($10^{15}$btu)
